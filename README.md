# ONC-Prototype-Project
This repository contains all the code I wrote and the circuit design I worked on for the Ocean Networks Canada prototype project (UVic ENGR 120 group project). This includes pseudo-code design representations, initial testing code, visual representations of how the circuit communicates with the vex eco-system, and the breadboard circuit design. All the RobotC files are commented on to describe the purpose of each block of code and function.
